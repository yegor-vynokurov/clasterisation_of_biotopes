# Clustering and detection of relationships between plant species in 111 biotopes of Armenia.
**Database**: 747 plant species in 111 locations were analyzed. For each location, the number of plants in standardized quantity units is determined.

**Purpose**: Determine how the 111 locations can be grouped based on the number and species diversity of plants. To justify the indicators by which localities are grouped.

**Relevance**: If we know exactly what type of location we have in front of us, we won't need to enumerate all the plants in it to establish changes or dependencies. It will only be necessary to evaluate the most important species for this type of plot, and to make assumptions about its general dynamics: whether the species composition is enriched or impoverished, whether the plot turns into another type or remains a stable system.

**Methods**:

Obtaining ratings of plants regarding their interaction with each other in the ecosystem.
Creation of clusters on the basis of received ratings of plants.
